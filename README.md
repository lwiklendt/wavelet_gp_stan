Work in progress.

`run_wavelet.py` to perform wavelet transforms.

`run_stan.py` to perform inference on wavelet transform results.

Specify a `toml` configuration file as the argument to each of the above scripts, with examples in `examples/`.

Performs the same inference work as in [https://github.com/lwiklendt/gp_kron_stan](https://github.com/lwiklendt/gp_kron_stan) and wavelet transform work as in [https://github.com/lwiklendt/lsw](https://github.com/lwiklendt/lsw) but attempting a more user-friendly interface via configuration files rather than via python coding.
